# LIRI-NODE-APP

Week 10 Homework

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Getting Started

Open the command line and type in "node liri.js" followed by the command and a search term if applicable. The command options are my-tweets, spotify-this-song, movie-this, and do-what-it-says. The search terms are only available for the last three commands. The search, if multiple words, must be enclosed in single quotes in order to run properly. Otherwise, it will only take in the first search term entered.

### Prerequisites

For this application to work, you will need to have installed the node-spotify-api, Twitter, and request NPM packages installed.

### Installing

To install an NPM package, type "npm install" followed by the NPM package name.
